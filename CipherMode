1. CipherMode.CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
Pros:

Introduces feedback, ensuring that even identical plaintext blocks encrypt to different ciphertext blocks.
Widely used and secure when implemented correctly.
Suitable for encrypting structured data (e.g., files, messages).
Cons:

Requires an Initialization Vector (IV), which must be unique for each encryption session.
Vulnerable to padding oracle attacks if padding and IVs are mishandled.
Encryption and decryption are sequential, making it less performant for parallel processing.
Best For: General-purpose encryption when data patterns need to be obscured and performance concerns are secondary.

2. CipherMode.ECB (Electronic Codebook)
Pros:

Simple and fast.
Easy to implement because it does not require an IV.
Cons:

Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks, revealing patterns.
Vulnerable to various attacks, such as block substitution and key recovery.
Best For: Almost nothing. Avoid using ECB for most purposes because of its significant security weaknesses.

3. CipherMode.OFB (Output Feedback)
Pros:

Converts the block cipher into a stream cipher, which processes data incrementally.
Resistant to error propagation: if one bit of ciphertext is altered, only the corresponding bit of plaintext is affected.
No padding is required.
Cons:

Requires a unique IV for security.
Less commonly used than CBC or CTR, so it may have limited support or fewer optimizations.
Best For: Streaming applications or scenarios where error resilience is essential.

4. CipherMode.CFB (Cipher Feedback)
Pros:

Also converts the block cipher into a stream cipher, allowing encryption of small increments of data.
Supports variable feedback sizes, providing flexibility.
Secure for streaming and incremental data processing.
Cons:

Error propagation: if a bit in the ciphertext is altered, multiple plaintext bits may be corrupted.
Performance is generally slower compared to OFB or CTR.
Best For: Streaming applications or when flexibility in feedback size is necessary.

5. CipherMode.CTS (Cipher Text Stealing)
Pros:

Allows encryption of plaintexts of any length without padding.
Produces ciphertext that matches the plaintext length.
Cons:

Behavior differs for the last two blocks of data, which can complicate implementation.
Less commonly supported compared to CBC or other standard modes.
Best For: Encrypting data where maintaining exact ciphertext length is critical, such as in database fields or legacy systems.

Which is "better"?
Most Secure & Widely Used: CBC is the most commonly used and trusted mode when paired with good practices (unique IVs and secure padding).
Streaming and Incremental Processing: Choose CFB or OFB if you need stream cipher-like behavior.
Avoid: ECB, as it is insecure for almost all use cases.
Specialized Use Cases: Use CTS if exact ciphertext length matching is required.
For most general-purpose applications, CBC is a safe and effective choice. If high performance or parallelization is a priority, consider CTR mode (not listed here) or OFB.
