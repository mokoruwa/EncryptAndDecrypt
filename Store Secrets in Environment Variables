2. Use IIS Application Pool Identity (Environment Variables)
Store sensitive information as environment variables on the server and configure the application to access them.

Steps to Store in Environment Variables
Add an Environment Variable:

Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
Under System Variables, click New and add:
Variable Name: Credentials
Variable Value: user@example.com|superSecretPassword|12345
Access in Code: Use Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable in your application to retrieve the value:

csharp
Copy code
string credentials = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("Credentials");
Benefits:

Environment variables are not directly accessible in application files.
Easy to update without modifying application code.
